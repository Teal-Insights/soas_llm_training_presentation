From [Dell'Acqua et al 2023](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4573321)

**Inside the frontier**: AI excels  
**Outside the frontier**: AI struggles  
**The challenge**: The boundary is invisible, unpredictable, and moving quickly



---

## The Jagged Frontier in Action {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Single prompt: "Make a painting of a dumpster fire in the style of Monet"**

![Made by ChatGPT in seconds](images/dumpster_fire.png){width="300px"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**One hour of prompting: "Make a better jagged frontier visualization"**

![Non-sensical output after countless attempts](images/bad_jagged_frontier.png){width="400px"}
:::
:::

**This is the jagged frontier**: Seemingly similar tasks with wildly different AI performance

---

## Understanding the Frontier {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

---

## Finding Your Frontier {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**How to discover what works for your research:**

::: {.incremental}
- **Start with your own work**: Test AI on papers you know intimately
- **Begin with low-stakes tasks**: Where errors won't matter much
- **Test systematically**: Try similar but different tasks to map boundaries
- **Stay updated**: The frontier is expanding rapidly but unevenly
:::

**Key principle**: Which tasks in your workflow are slow, repetitive, or cognitively exhausting?

Try them with an LLM. Does it help or hinder?

---

## Why This Matters: Democratizing Ambitious Research {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**The bigger picture**: Tools that enable more researchers to tackle urgent questions at scale

::: {.incremental}
- **Previously required**: Large research grants, teams of research assistants, months of work

## Best Practices for Research Coding {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**Strategic approach:**

::: {.incremental}
1. **Use most advanced models** - Pay for premium access ($20/month is worth it)
2. **Start with your own expertise** - Test AI on code you know well
3. **Provide complete context** - Include data structure, expected outputs, error messages
4. **Break complex tasks into steps** - Don't ask for entire analysis at once
5. **Always validate outputs** - Check results against known answers

## R Tidyverse Example {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**Prompt for data analysis:**

```markdown
I'm analyzing survey data on household income and education. 
I have columns: household_id, income, education, region, year.

Using R tidyverse style with the base R pipe |>, help me:
1. Calculate median income by region and education level
2. Create a summary table showing trends over time
3. Generate a clean visualization for publication

Please include comments and use the tidyverse style guide.
```

**Result**: AI generates clean, documented code following your preferences

## Validation Strategies for AI Code {background-color="#fff3cd"}

**Essential practices:**

::: {.incremental}
1. **Test with known data** - Use datasets where you know expected results
2. **Start small** - Test functions with simple examples first
3. **Manual verification** - Check AI calculations against hand calculations
4. **Cross-platform validation** - Compare results across different tools
5. **Peer review** - Have colleagues examine AI-generated code
