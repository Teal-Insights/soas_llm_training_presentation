# Part 1: Mental Model {background-color="#1e4a5f"}

## Understanding How To Work With AI Effectively

**What we're building**: Strategic thinking about AI capabilities

---

## The Research Reality {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**Information overload is real:**

- Too many papers to read
- Cross-disciplinary insights trapped in jargon
- Important work in other languages
- Routine tasks eating research time

**💬 Chat**: *Share one routine task that consumes too much of your time*

**The opportunity**: What if AI could handle the routine so you focus on insight?

---

## Two Ways to Access AI {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Web Interfaces** *(Our focus)*

- Browser-based (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- No coding required
- Interactive conversation
- **Best for**: Exploration, individual tasks
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**APIs** *(Advanced)*

- Programmatic access
- Requires coding
- Automated workflows
- **Best for**: Large-scale projects
:::
:::

**Today**: Web interfaces | **Case study**: How APIs enabled our China project

---

## The Jagged Frontier {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

![AI capabilities form an irregular, unpredictable boundary](images/jagged_frontier.png){fig-alt="Jagged frontier diagram"}

**Key insight from Ethan Mollick's research:**

- Tasks inside frontier: AI excels
- Tasks outside: AI struggles
- The boundary is invisible and shifts

---

## Jagged Frontier in Action {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**"Paint a dumpster fire in Monet's style"**

![Perfect in seconds](images/dumpster_fire.png){width="300px"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**"Make a better jagged frontier diagram"**

![Failed after an hour](images/bad_jagged_frontier.png){width="400px"}
:::
:::

**The lesson**: You must explore the frontier for YOUR tasks

---

## Low-Hanging Fruit {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**Where AI consistently saves researchers time:**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Literature Tasks** 📚

- Summarizing papers
- Finding patterns
- Translation (language & jargon)
- Initial categorization
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Coding Tasks** 💻

- Data cleaning scripts
- Statistical analysis
- Debugging errors
- Documentation
:::
:::

**These are INSIDE the frontier** - reliable time-savers

---

## Why Collaborative? {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**Think of AI as an infinitely patient research assistant**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**You Provide**

- Domain expertise
- Research questions
- Quality judgment
- Ethical framework
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**AI Provides**

- Processing speed
- Pattern recognition
- Multiple drafts
- Tireless consistency
:::
:::

**Key principle**: AI amplifies expertise, doesn't replace it

---

## Tool Selection: Why Gemini Today {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**Three major providers, each with strengths:**

- **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**: Best "Deep Research" tool
- **Anthropic (Claude)**: Excellent for coding
- **Google (Gemini)**: Largest context window

**Context window** = Working memory

- Gemini: ~750,000 words (15 papers)
- Others: ~150,000 words (3 papers)

**For academic work**: Gemini's massive context + citations = best choice

---

## What Makes AI Different {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**Traditional software**: Predictable rules, consistent outputs

**LLMs**: More like a knowledgeable but quirky colleague

- Sometimes brilliant insights
- Sometimes confident nonsense
- Always needs verification
- Success depends on how you communicate

**This is why prompting matters** - it's how you communicate effectively

---

## Signpost: From Theory to Practice {.center background-color="#4a90b8"}

### You now understand:
✓ Jagged frontier concept  
✓ Where AI excels (literature, coding)  
✓ Why collaboration works  
✓ Tool options

### Next: Build your toolkit with three cumulative activities

---

# Part 2: Three Cumulative Tools {background-color="#1e4a5f"}

## Building Your AI Research Toolkit

**What we're building**: Practical tools you'll use immediately

---

## The Foundation: Why Prompting Matters {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**LLMs are powerful but not clairvoyant**

They need:

- **Context**: Who you are, what you're working on
- **Clear instructions**: Specific tasks, not vague requests
- **Output format**: How you want results structured
- **Quality controls**: Ways to verify accuracy

**Analogy**: Like briefing a new research assistant who's brilliant but knows nothing about your work

---

## Anatomy of Effective Prompts {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

```markdown
CONTEXT: Background information, your expertise, project details

TASK: Specific request with clear action verbs

FORMAT: Structure, length, style preferences  

CONSTRAINTS: What to avoid, limitations, requirements

QUALITY CONTROLS: "Ask clarifying questions", "Tell me when unsure"
```

**Each element improves output quality**

---

## Tool 1: Professional Context {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**The problem**: Starting from scratch every conversation

**The solution**: Reusable professional context that captures:

- Your expertise and background
- Research focus areas
- Communication style
- Methodological preferences

**Why this matters**: Foundation for all future AI interactions

---

## 🔧 Activity 1: Create Your Context {background-color="#4a90b8"}

### Build Your AI Foundation *(8 minutes)*{.text-teal}

1. Go to [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)
2. Upload your CV, bio, or LinkedIn profile
3. Use this prompt:

```markdown
Analyze my professional background and create a 200-300 word 
professional context for AI interactions including:

- Domain expertise & background
- Current roles & affiliations  
- Research focus areas
- Communication style & audience
- Technical approaches I use

Make it professional but conversational.
```

---

## Activity 1 Walkthrough {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**Step by step:**

1. **Upload** → CV or professional bio
2. **Paste prompt** → Exactly as shown
3. **Review** → Does it capture your expertise?
4. **Refine** → "Make it more concise" or "Add my regional expertise"
5. **Save** → Copy to a document for reuse

**Success indicator**: AI understands your research domain and communication needs

<div class="time-indicator">⏱️ 8 minutes</div>

---

## Checkpoint: What You Built {background-color="#d4edda"}

✅ **Professional context that:**

- Introduces you to any AI system
- Captures your unique expertise
- Sets appropriate communication style
- Eliminates repetitive explanations

**This becomes part of EVERY future prompt**

---

## Tool 2: Enhanced Prompting {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**Now we combine context with structured requests**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Without structure** ❌
"Help with literature review"

Vague → Generic output
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**With structure** ✅
Context + Task + Format

Specific → Useful output
:::
:::

**The magic**: Your context + clear structure = targeted assistance

---

## Why Structure Works {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**Two powerful additions to any prompt:**

1. **"Ask me clarifying questions"**

   - AI seeks missing information
   - Prevents assumptions
   
2. **"Tell me when you're unsure"**  

   - Reduces hallucinations
   - Flags uncertainty

**These simple phrases dramatically improve reliability**

---

## 🔧 Activity 2: Enhanced Prompting {background-color="#4a90b8"}

### Transform Vague to Powerful *(10 minutes)*{.text-teal}

Build on Activity 1 by adding structure:

```markdown
[Your professional context from Activity 1]

I'm working on [specific research question/paper/project].

Please help me [specific task]:
- [What you want]
- [How it should be formatted]
- [Any constraints]

Ask clarifying questions if needed.
Tell me when you're unsure about something.
```

---

## Activity 2 Practice {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**Try it with a real research need:**

1. **Paste your context** (from Activity 1)
2. **Add current research** - Be specific, add context, upload documents
3. **Structure your request** - Task, format, constraints
4. **Include quality controls** - Questions and uncertainty
5. **Compare results** - How does this differ from a vague request?

**💬 Chat**: *What surprised you about the enhanced response?*

<div class="time-indicator">⏱️ 10 minutes</div>

---

## The Compounding Effect {background-color="#d4edda"}

✅ **What you've discovered:**

- Context → No more generic responses
- Structure → Clear, actionable outputs
- Quality controls → Reduced errors
- **Together** → AI that understands YOUR research needs

**Next**: Apply this to your biggest time sink - literature review

---

## Tool 3: Literature Review Enhancement {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**The universal research challenge:**

- Explosion of publications
- Relevant work in other languages
- Insights trapped in other disciplines
- No time to read everything

**Initial literature review is prime "low-hanging fruit"** - squarely inside AI's capabilities

---

## My Personal Workflow {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**For every potentially relevant paper:**

```markdown
[Professional context]

Please provide the full citation information for this document at the top, then create a detailed structured summary of this entire document, including any appendices.

I need to understand:
- The main argument or purpose
- Key findings or conclusions
- Important data, evidence, or examples
- Any policy implications or practical applications
- Who the intended audience appears to be

Format this as a structured summary with clear headings.
```

**Result**: 5% merit deep reading, 95% the summary is sufficient

---

## Two Translation Superpowers {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Language Translation** 🌍

- Spanish economics paper → English
- Chinese policy document → English
- Initial assessment of relevance
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Jargon Translation** 🔄

- Economics → Plain English
- Computer science → Social science
- Technical → Policymaker-friendly
:::
:::

**Both expand your research scope dramatically**

---

## Cross-Disciplinary Example {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

```markdown
[Your context]

This computer science paper uses unfamiliar technical terminology. 
Please:
1. Identify the main contribution in plain language
2. Explain how their methods might apply to social science research  
3. Highlight any useful techniques for [your research area]

:::
:::

**Success key**: You provide research logic and context, AI handles syntax

---

## The Promise and The Peril {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Promise** 🚀

- 10x faster for routine tasks
- Learn new languages quickly
- Better documentation
- Fewer silly errors
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Peril** ⚠️

- "Vibe coding" - looks right, runs wrong
- Hallucinated functions
- The 0-to-90% problem
- Overconfidence in output
:::
:::

**Critical**: You need to understand your code. Always validate results. 

---

## What is "Vibe Coding"? {background-color="#fff3cd"}

**The dangerous phenomenon where:**

- Code looks professional ✓
- Runs without errors ✓  
- Produces wrong results ✗

**Example**: Statistical test that always returns p < 0.05

**Protection**: 

- Test with known data
- Verify calculations manually
- Check package documentation

---

## Best Practices for Research Coding {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

1. **Use advanced models** - Claude for coding, worth the $20/month
2. **Provide complete context** - Data structure, expected output
3. **Work iteratively** - Build step by step, test each part
4. **Include your preferences** - "Use tidyverse style with base R pipe"
5. **Always validate** - Check against known results

---

## Effective Coding Prompts {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

```markdown
[Your context including preferred languages/packages]

I have survey data with columns: household_id, income, education, 
region, year. The data has some missing values.

Using R with tidyverse style and base R pipe |>, please:
1. Create a script to calculate and visualize median income by region and education
2. Create plots to help me understand  how to handle missing data appropriately  
4. Include comments explaining each step

Note: I prefer functional programming (purrr) over loops.
```

✓ Mental model (jagged frontier)  
✓ Three practical tools  
✓ Understanding of low-hanging fruit

### Next: What becomes possible at scale

---

# Part 3: Scaling Up {background-color="#1e4a5f"}

## From Web Interfaces to APIs

**What we're exploring**: How these tools enable ambitious research

---

## Back to China: The Full Challenge {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**Research question**: Given policy chatter about the "Green Belt & Road," what do we know about China's role in funding the energy transition in developing countries?

**The data**: 18,000 lending projects needing classification

- 🟢 Green: Solar, wind, hydro, nuclear
- 🟫 Brown: Coal, oil, fossil fuels  
- 🔘 Grey: Mixed/indirect (transmission lines)
- ⚪ Neutral: Non-energy

**The constraint**: Ambitious project, limited budget

---

## Web Interface vs API Approach {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What you've learned** 🖥️

- Manual chat interface
- One document at a time
- Great for exploration
- No coding required
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**What we used** 🔧

- Programmatic API
- Thousands automatically
- Systematic processing
- Required Python or R 
:::
:::

**Same AI, different access method**

---

## The Scale Mathematics {.center background-color="#4a90b8"}

### Manual Classification
**1,500 hours** × **$15/hour** = **$22,500**

### Our API Approach  
**15 hours** × **$0.11/hour** = **$1.58**

### 100x faster, 14,000x cheaper

---

## Why Context Beat Keywords {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**Real example**: "500MW solar power plant with backup diesel generator"

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Keyword approach** ❌

- Searches for "diesel"
- Classifies as brown
- Misses primary purpose
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**LLM approach** ✅

- Reads full description
- Understands context
- Correctly identifies as green
:::
:::

**This is the jagged frontier in action**

---

## Our Development Journey {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[10 examples<br/>Test concept] --> B[100 examples<br/>Refine approach]
    B --> C[300 examples<br/>Validate]
    C --> D[18,000 projects<br/>Full scale]
```

**Key insight**: Start small, validate early, scale confidently

---

## Validation: The Critical Step {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![Model agreement analysis](images/llm_agreement_analysis.png){width="400px"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Our approach:**

- Test multiple models

**Transparency enables trust and progress**

---

## What We Discovered {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

![China's green lending: mostly hydro, minimal solar/wind](images/odi_green_lending_trends.png)

**Only possible through scale** - patterns invisible in small samples

---

## Lessons for Your Research {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

1. **Start where you are** - Web interfaces are powerful enough for most tasks
2. **Think about scale** - What questions could you ask with unlimited processing?
3. **Validation is everything** - Build it in from the start
4. **Share your methods** - We all benefit from transparency
5. **Perfect < Good enough** - 92% accurate on 18,000 beats 100% on 100

---

## When to Consider APIs {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**Stay with web interfaces when:**

- Exploring and learning
- Need flexibility
- Not a confident R or Python programmer

**Consider APIs when:**

- Processing a large number of items
- Repeating same analysis
- Need systematic approach
- Have strong coding skills or coding support

**Most research stays in the first category**

---
