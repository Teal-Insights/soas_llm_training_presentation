**Strategic approach:**

::: {.incremental}
1. **Use most advanced models** - Pay for premium access ($20/month is worth it)
2. **Start with your own expertise** - Test AI on code you know well
3. **Provide complete context** - Include data structure, expected outputs, error messages
4. **Break complex tasks into steps** - Don't ask for entire analysis at once
5. **Always validate outputs** - Check results against known answers
:::

**üìñ Comprehensive guide**: Chapter 8 for coding best practices

## R Tidyverse Example {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**Prompt for data analysis:**

```markdown
I'm analyzing survey data on household income and education. 
I have columns: household_id, income, education, region, year.

Using R tidyverse style with the base R pipe |>, help me:
1. Calculate median income by region and education level
2. Create a summary table showing trends over time
3. Generate a clean visualization for publication

Please include comments and use the tidyverse style guide.
```

**Result**: AI generates clean, documented code following your preferences

# Part 3: Advanced Possibilities {background-color="#1e4a5f"}

## Case Study: Using LLMs at Scale

**What we're exploring**: How AI enables policy-relevant research at scale

---

## The Policy Challenge {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**Understanding China's Role in Financing the Energy Transition**

::: {.incremental}
- China: Key source of lending to developing countries
- Policy pronouncements about "Green Belt and Road Initiative"
- Emphasis on "small and beautiful" projects
- Shift from policy banks to commercial co-financing
:::

**Critical questions**: Was China actually supporting green transition? Who was participating? What scale?

---

## The Classification Challenge {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**18,000 Chinese overseas lending projects** from AidData's database

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Categories needed**:

- üü¢ **Green**: Solar, wind, hydro, nuclear
- üü´ **Brown**: Coal, oil, fossil fuels
- üîò **Grey**: Indirect impacts (transmission)
- ‚ö™ **Neutral**: Non-energy projects
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Traditional approach**:

- 1,500 hours of work
- $22,500 in research costs
- Large grant funding required
:::
:::

**Our result**: Completed in 15 hours for $1.58

---

## The Reality of Human vs. LLM Classification {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**Let's be honest about manual classification at scale:**

::: {.incremental}
- After a few hours, your eyes glaze over
- Are you applying criteria consistently?
- Are you coding the same way as yesterday? Last week?
- Research assistants face the same challenges
:::

**LLMs bring endless patience and consistency**

- Apply same criteria to project 17,000 as to project 1
- No fatigue, no drift in standards, no bad days
- Your LLM didn't stay out partying until 4 AM

**Key insight**: Not about perfection, but about good-enough accuracy with perfect consistency

---

## Why Keywords Failed, Context Succeeded {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**Example project**: *"Development of 500MW solar power plant with backup diesel generator"*

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**‚ùå Keyword Search**

- Sees "diesel" 
- Classifies as brown
- Misses primary purpose
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**‚úÖ LLM Context Understanding**

- Reads entire description
- Understands primary purpose
- Recognizes backup as auxiliary
- Correctly classifies as green
:::
:::

**The advantage**: LLMs understand context that keyword searches miss entirely

---

## Our Development Journey {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**Phase 1: Getting Started** *(5-10 examples)*

- Test basic concepts
- Refine classification framework

**Phase 2: Working Out Kinks** *(~30 examples)*

- Handle edge cases and mixed projects
- Develop nuanced reasoning

**Phase 3: Infrastructure Testing** *(100 projects)*

- Test API calls and error handling
- Build processing pipelines

**Phase 4: Validation Strategy** *(300 projects)*

- Test multiple models against human judgment
- Measure reliability and accuracy

**Phase 5: Full Implementation** *(18,000 projects)*

- Process complete dataset with confidence

---

## What Made Our Approach Work {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**Multi-shot prompting**: Showed AI how to reason through complex cases

**Structured output**: Required JSON format with confidence levels

**Confidence calibration**: AI assessed its own certainty

- **HIGH**: Clear alignment with categories
- **MEDIUM**: Some ambiguity but reasonable certainty
- **LOW**: Significant uncertainty - flag for human review

**Key insight**: When AI said it was uncertain, it usually was

---

## Validation Strategy {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**Step 1: Inter-Model Agreement**

- Tested different LLMs on same projects
- High agreement (85-95%) on most categories
- Deepseek v3 emerged as best performer

**Step 2: Human Validation Benchmark**

- 300 projects manually classified by experts
- **91.8% agreement** with human ratings
- **95.5% accuracy** on green projects specifically

![LLM Agreement Analysis](images/llm_agreement_analysis.png){width="600px"}

---

## The Unexpected Challenge {background-color="#fff3cd"}

All LLM providers do some type of content moderation. 

Using Deepseek (an LLM from a Chinese AI lab) required "Non Traditional Debugging" to sanitize politically sensitive names.

![Non-traditional debugging approach](images/non_traditional_debugging.png){width="300px"}

---

## What We Discovered {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

![Trends in Chinese overseas lending by project type](images/odi_green_lending_trends.png){width="800px"}

**Key findings challenged conventional wisdom**:

- Only **$86.5 billion in green investments** (5.8% of total)
- **No green surge over time** despite policy rhetoric
- **Bifurcated co-financing networks** - green and commercial financing remain separate

---

## The Transformation of Research Possibilities {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**This wasn't about doing the impossible**

- Large teams could have done this manually
- It would have required major grant funding

**This was about democratizing ambitious research**

**Key insight**: AI handles mechanical tasks while humans focus on research design, validation, and interpretation

---
