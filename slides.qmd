## How I Got Here {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
![Greener on the Other Side - ODI Global Report](images/odi_cover_page.png){width="300px"}
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
**April 2025**: Published ["Greener on the other side?"](https://odi.org/en/publications/greener-on-the-other-side-mapping-chinas-overseas-co-financing-and-financial-innovation/) using AI to classify 18,000 Chinese lending projects

**After publication**: Professor Carlos Oya reached out

**Today**: First time teaching a workshop on LLMs, but figured it was a great way to gather my thoughts on something I've been thinking about a lot

## China's Green Lending Reality {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

![Trends in Chinese overseas lending by project type](images/odi_green_lending_trends.png)

**What we discovered**: Despite "Green Belt and Road" rhetoric, minimal actual renewable energy financing

**LLM Best Practices**: No established best practices. We are trying to start that conversation

## My Take on AI {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**There are real problems with AI** ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Bias and training data issues
- Hallucinations and false confidence
- Serious social & ethical issues
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Despite this...** üí°

- I believe AI can be a powerful tool for those of us who want to make the world a better place

**Value I can add**: 

- I've spent a lot of time figuring out what works and what doesn't. I can share my practical experience with you.

## My Relevant AI Experience {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

::: {.incremental}
- **ODI research project**: 18,000 project classification in 15 hours vs. 1,500 hours manually for cost of $1.58.
- **Day job**: Running Teal Insights, where we help Global South finance ministries navigate complex debt sustainability and climate investment challenges.
- **Our approach**: Small team (US, Nigeria, Kenya) using AI tools heavily to amplify our impact in research and code development.
- **Building LLM products**: To facilitate our research process and help countries avoid expensive consulting fees
:::

## Other Relevant Experience

::: {.nonincremental}
-   **EM sovereign debt research analyst**, Morgan Stanley Investment Management 
-   **Adjunct Lecturer**, Johns Hopkins SAIS (teaching students to do real-world data analysis on financial and sustainability data)
-   **Thought leadership** on sovereign debt + sustainability, World Bank
-   **Chinese debt restructuring & flows** research, AidData
-   **Big nerd** ü§ì

# Part 1: Foundations {background-color="#1e4a5f"}

## Understanding the Research Reality

**What we're exploring**: Why this matters & how to think about AI strategically

---

## The Scale Problem We All Face {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**The literature explosion**

- Too much to read, too little time

**Your reality**

- Deep expertise, but finite time
- Job, family, life outside research
- Can't read everything that looks relevant

**üí¨ Chat**: *Share one research task you find tedious*

---

## Approach to AI {background-color="#fff3cd"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### ‚ùå Avoiding

- Replacing your critical thinking
- Trusting AI without verification  
- Ignoring bias and limitations
- Displacing human expertise
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### ‚úÖ Amplifying

- Your domain knowledge
- Your analytical capabilities  
- Your research capacity
- Your time for deep thinking
:::
:::

**Key insight**: AI handles routine so you focus on remarkable

## Mental Model: The "Jagged Frontier" {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

![What is AI good at?](images/jagged_frontier.png){fig-alt="Detailed frontier diagram showing task categories"}

**Inside the frontier**: AI excels  
**Outside the frontier**: AI struggles  
**The challenge**: The boundary is invisible, unpredictable, and moving quickly

---

## The Jagged Frontier in Action {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Single prompt: "Make a painting of a dumpster fire in the style of Monet"**

![Made by ChatGPT in seconds](images/dumpster_fire.png){width="300px"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**One hour of prompting: "Make a better jagged frontier visualization"**

![Non-sensical output after countless attempts](images/bad_jagged_frontier.png){width="400px"}
:::
:::

**This is the jagged frontier**: Seemingly similar tasks with wildly different AI performance

---

## Understanding the Frontier {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Inside (AI excels)**

- Summarizing complex texts
- Pattern recognition across documents
- Language translation
- First-draft generation
- Code generation
- Processing large volumes quickly
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Outside (AI struggles)**  

- Understanding implicit context
- Grasping unwritten assumptions
- Making ethical judgments
- Recognizing what's missing
- Cultural and political subtext
:::
:::

**Only YOU can find the "jagged frontier" for tasks that matter to you**

---

## The Collaborative Model {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**Think of LLMs as sophisticated research assistants with unique strengths and blind spots**

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Your Unique Value**

- Domain expertise & contextual understanding
- Critical analysis & theoretical frameworks
- Ethical judgment & interpretation
- Understanding implicit meanings
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**AI's Unique Value**

- Processing large volumes quickly
- Identifying patterns across documents
- Generating first drafts
- Handling routine tasks
- Providing different perspectives
:::
:::

**The goal**: AI amplifies your expertise, doesn't replace it

---

## Finding Your Frontier {background-color="#f8f9fa"}

**How to discover what works for your research:**

::: {.incremental}
- **Start with your own work**: Test AI on papers you know intimately
- **Begin with low-stakes tasks**: Where errors won't matter much
- **Test systematically**: Try similar but different tasks to map boundaries
- **Stay updated**: The frontier is expanding rapidly but unevenly
:::

**Key principle**: Which tasks in your workflow are slow, repetitive, or cognitively exhausting?

Try them with an LLM. Does it help or hinder?

---

## Democratizing Ambitious Research {background-color="#e8f4f8"}

**The bigger picture**: Tools that enable more researchers to tackle urgent questions at scale

::: {.incremental}
- **Previously required**: Large research grants, teams of research assistants, months of work
- **Now possible**: Two policy researchers with minimal budget accomplished analysis that traditionally required large, well-funded teams
- **What this enables**: More ambitious, policy-relevant research while maintaining academic rigor
- **The promise**: Not replacing researchers, but enabling more transparent and impactful research
:::

We face urgent policy challenges around climate finance, development effectiveness, and global economic transitions

---

## Key Takeaways from Foundations {background-color="#d4edda"}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**The Challenge**

- Information overload in academic research
- Limited time for comprehensive literature review
- Need for strategic filtering and prioritization
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Your Strategic Advantage**

- Understanding the jagged frontier
- Finding your personal frontier through experimentation
- Collaborative approach: AI handles scale, you provide judgment
:::
:::

**Next**: We'll put this into practice with hands-on tools and techniques
